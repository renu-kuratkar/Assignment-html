    <p colur="red">Haldiram's began as a tiny shop in Bikaner, the land as famed for its savouries as for its leather-faced 
        pipe players and fierce warriors.By 1982, Haldiram's had set up shop in Delhi and the capital had 
        begun to stop by and take note of the savouries and sweets.It was word of mouth that grew the 
        business manifold over the next decade till Haldiram's came tostand for a food company that was 
        synonymous with taste,hygeiene and innovation.</p>
    <p>USA was the first market we started exporting to, thanks to the large Indianpopulation there.We 
        began with about 15 products, all savouries, because they are a favourite with Indians.
    </p>
    <p>What began as a small-town enterprise in india is today a globalphenomenon. Haldiram's is a way of life for Indians no matter whichcountry 
    they live in.And the Countries they live in are also fast developing a penchant for these products.</p>
