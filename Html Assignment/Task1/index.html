    <h4>Introduction of Maharana Pratap:</h2>
    <p>
         Maharana Pratap, is a name worth remembering to begin 
        one’s day with. His name is engraved with gold among the list of valiant kings who protected the Nation, Dharma, Culture and Freedom of this country by sacrificing his life ! This is a holy remembrance of his valour ! Who does not know the name of the great king of Mewar, Maharana Pratap Singh? In the history of India, this name has always proved to be motivating for qualities like valour, bravery, sacrifice and martyrdom. Many brave warriors like Bappa Rawal, Rana Hamir, Rana Sang were born unto the Sisodiya family of Mewar
         and were given the title of ‘Rana’ but the title of ‘Maharana’ was only bestowed on Pratap Singh.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Childhood of Maharana Pratap:</h4>
    <p>
        Maharana Pratap was born in 1540. Rana Uday Singh, the Second, of Mewar had 33 children. 
        Among them, the eldest was Pratap Singh. Self-respect and virtuous behaviour were the main qualities 
        of Pratap Singh. Maharana Pratap was bold and brave right from his childhood and everyone was sure 
        that he was going to be a very valiant person as he grew up. He was more interested in sports and 
        learning to wield weapons rather than general education
    </p>
    <h4>Maharana Pratap’s Coronation:</h4>
    <p>
        During Maharana Pratap Singhâ€™s time, Akbar was the Mughal Ruler in Delhi. His policy was to make 
        use of the strength of Hindu kings to bring other Hindu Kings under his control. Many Rajput kings,
         abandoning their glorious traditions and fighting spirit, sent their daughters and daughters-in-law 
         to the harem of Akbar with the purpose of gaining rewards and honour from Akbar. Uday Singh 
         appointed before his death, Jagammal, the son of his youngest wife as his heir although Pratap Singh
         was elder to Jagammal but he was ready to give up his rights like Prabhu Ramchandra and go away 
         from Mewar but the chieftains did not at all agree with their kingâ€™s decision. Besides they were
          of the opinion that Jagammal did not possess qualities like courage and self-respect which were 
          essential in a leader and king. Hence it was collectively decided that Jagammal would have to 
          sacrifice the throne. Maharana Pratap Singh too gave due respect to the wish of the chieftains
           and the people and accepted the responsibility of leading the people of Mewar. 
 
    </p>
    <h4>Unbreakable Oath of Maharana Pratap to free the ‘Motherland’:</h4>
    <p>
        
 
 Maharana Pratapâ€™s enemy had surrounded Mewar at all itsâ€™ boundaries. Shakti Singh and Jagammal, 
 the two brothers of Maharana Pratap had joined Akbar. The first problem was to gather enough soldiers to 
 fight a face-to-face war which would have required vast money but Maharana Pratapâ€™s coffers were empty 
 whereas Akbar had a large army, a lot of wealth and a lot more at his disposal. Maharana Pratap, however,
  did not get distracted or lose heart nor did he ever say that he was weak as compared to Akbar.
 Maharana Pratapâ€™s only concern was to immediately free his motherland from the clutches of the Mughals. One day, he called a meeting of his trusted chieftains and made an appeal to them in his serious and lustrous speech. He said, â€œMy brave warrior brothers, our Motherland, this holy land of Mewar, is still under the clutches of the Mughals. Today, I take an oath in front of all of you that till Chittod is freed, I will not have food in gold and silver plates, will not sleep on a soft bed and will not stay in the palace; instead I will eat food on a leaf-platter, sleep on the floor and stay in a hut. I will also not shave till Chittod is freed. My brave warriors, I am sure that you will support me in every way sacrificing your mind, body and wealth till this oath is fulfilled.â€ All the chieftains were inspired with the oath of their king and they too promised him that till their last drop of blood, they would help Rana Pratap Singh to free Chittod and join him in fighting the Mughals; they would not retreat from their goal. They assured him, â€œRana, be sure that we all are with you; waiting only for your signal and we are ready to sacrifice our life.â€

    <h4>Battle of Haldighat : Supreme fighter ‘Maharana Pratap’:</h4>
    <p>
        Akbar tried his best to bring Maharana Pratap under his clutches; but all in vain. Akbar got angry as
         no compromise could be arrived at with Maharana Pratap and he declared a war. Maharana Pratap also
         started preparations. He shifted his capital to Kumbhalgad in the Aravalli range of mountains which 
         was difficult to access. Maharana Pratap recruited tribal people and people dwelling in forests in 
         his army. These people had no experience of fighting any war; but he trained them. He appealed to
          all Rajput chieftains to come under one flag for Mewar independence.
         Maharana Pratapâ€™s army of 22,000 soldiers met 2,00,000 soldiers of Akbar at Haldighat. Maharana Pratap and his soldiers exhibited great valour in this battle although he had to retreat but Akbar's army was not successful in completely defeating Rana Pratap. 
        
        Maharana Pratap and his faithful horse named â€˜Chetakâ€™ also became immortal in this battle. â€˜Chetakâ€™ was seriously injured in the battle of Haldighat but to save his masterâ€™s life, it jumped over a big canal. As soon as the canal was crossed, â€˜Chetakâ€™ fell down and died thus it saved Rana Pratap, risking its own life. The strong Maharana cried like a child over the death of his faithful horse. Later he constructed a beautiful garden at the place where Chetak had breathed its last. Then Akbar himself attacked Maharana Pratap but even after 6 months of fighting the battle, Akbar could not defeat Maharana Pratap and went back to Delhi. As a last resort, Akbar sent another great warrior General Jagannath in the year 1584 with a huge army to Mewar but after trying relentlessly for 2 years, even he could not catch Rana Pratap
