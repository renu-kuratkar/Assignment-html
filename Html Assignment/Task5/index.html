    <p>A class is a user-defined data-type used to bind data and its associated functions together. It allows the data
        (and functions) to be hidden, from external use. When defining a class, we are creating a new Abstract Data Type
        (ADT) that can be treated like any other built-in data type.


    </p>
    <p>

        The class body contains the declaration of variables and functions. These functions and variables are
        collectively called as members of the class. They are usually grouped under two visibility labels, namely,
        private and public.
    </p>
    <p>
        The members that have been declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions. Such data hiding
        using private declaration is the key feature of object-oriented programming. The use of the keyword private is
        optional. By default, members of a class are private. public members can be accessed from outside the class
        also.
    </p>
    <p>
        An object is an instance of a class. It can be uniquely identified by its name. It has physical existence in the
        memory.
        Once a class has been declared, we can create its objects in the same way as variables of any other type. Thus,
        an object is the variable of type class. Example:

    </p>
    <p>

        If a class student is declared then we can create object of name s as,
        Student s;

    <h2 id="2">Characteristics of a constructor function:<a href="#home">top</a></h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Its name is same as name of its parent class.</li>
        <li>It gets invoked implicitly when an object of its class is created.</li>
        <li>It should be declared in public section of the class.</li>
        <li>It does not have return-type, (not even void).</li>
        <li>It can have default arguments.</li>
        <li>It can be overloaded.</li>
        <li>It can not be inherited</li>
        <li>It can not be a virtual function.</li>
        <li>It can not contain argument of the same class to which it belongs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="3">Characteristics of a friend function:<a href="#home">top</a></h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Unlike member function, a friend function is not invoked using an object name and the dot operator. It is
            invoked like a normal function.</li>
        <li>It can not access member names directly. It needs to use dot operator and object name to access members of
            that object. (e.g. s.rollno)</li>
        <li>It can not use this keyword.</li>
        <li>It may be declared in any (private or public) part of the class.</li>
        <li>A friend function has at least one argument which is of the type of the class (of which it is a friend).
        </li>
        <li>A class can have many friend functions</li>
        <li>A function can be friend of many classes</li>
        <li>Member function of one class may be friend function of another class.</li>
        <li>Even a class can be friend of another class. In such case, all member functions of the friend class can
            access private members of the class.</li>
        <li>It is not in the scope of the class to which it has been declared as friend.</li>
        <li>A friend function is not inherited.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="4">Access Modifiers:<a href="#home">top</a></h2>
    <p>There are three types of access modifiers in C++:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>public: A member declared with public access modifier is accessible outside the class. Any global function,
            friend function, derived class and other class can access this member.
        </li>
        <li>private: A member declared with private access modifier is not accessible outside the class except its
            friend functions. A private member can not be accessed in derived classes also.</li>
        <li>protected: A member declared with protected access modifier is not accessible outside the class except its
            friend functions and derived classes.</li>
    </ul>
    <P>Following table summarizes scope of members with different access modifiers.
